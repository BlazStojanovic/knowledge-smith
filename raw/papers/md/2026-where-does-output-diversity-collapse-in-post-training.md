###### Abstract

Post-trained language models produce less varied outputs than their base counterparts. This output diversity collapse undermines inference-time scaling methods that rely on varied samples, and risks homogenizing model outputs on creative and value-laden tasks. Prior work attributes collapse to specific post-training methods, without separating the role of training data composition from the method, or the generation format from the model weights. We trace output diversity through three parallel post-training lineages of Olmo 3, Think (chain-of-thought distillation), Instruct (broad multi-source data), and RL-Zero, across 15 tasks and four text diversity metrics. We find that the location of collapse co-varies with data composition: the Think lineage loses most semantic diversity at supervised fine-tuning, and the effect of DPO is larger in Instruct than in Think. Suppressing chain-of-thought reasoning at inference in Think models drops accuracy on hard tasks, yet leaves answer-level diversity unchanged, showing that the collapse is embedded in the model weights by training data, not imposed by the generation format. Decomposing diversity loss on six verifiable tasks into a quality-control component (removal of incorrect outputs) and a residual component (genuine narrowing among correct outputs) reveals that the split is task-dependent, and Think models retain more correct-answer diversity than Instruct despite collapsing more in aggregate. Our results indicate that diversity collapse is determined during training by data composition and cannot be addressed at inference time alone.111Code: <https://github.com/ckarouzos/where-diversity-collapses/>

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) rely on post-training to improve helpfulness, safety, and instruction compliance. Post-training combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT; ouyang2022traininglanguagemodelsfollow) on curated demonstrations, and direct preference optimization (DPO; rafailov2023direct) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, this results in output diversity collapse, i.e., models produce more uniform outputs than their base counterparts across summarization (kirk2024understanding), reasoning (dang2025diversity), and open-ended generation (jiang2025hivemind).
Diversity collapse limits self-consistency (wang2023selfconsistency), pass@kk sampling (chen2021evaluatinglargelanguagemodels), and test-time compute scaling (snell2025scaling). kamigaito2025diversity show diversity is the mechanism underlying inference scaling laws. The algorithmic causes are well-understood (wang2024beyond; ma2025gradient; gxchen2025kl), yet diversity collapses across task types. This leads LLMs to produce less diverse outputs than a basic web search (wright2025epistemic), co-writing with LLMs reduces content diversity (padmakumar2024writing), and single-reward RLHF can amplify majority preferences to near-total dominance (chakraborty2024maxmin).

Yet, prior work attributes collapse to specific algorithms. DPO in narrative generation (peeperkorn2025mindgapconformativedecoding), the reward step in creative tasks (omahony2024attributing), and SFT in reasoning (dang2025diversity), without investigating the effect of *data* compositions. ma2025reasoning suppress chain-of-thought (CoT; wei2022chain) at inference but measure only accuracy, not diversity. No existing study isolates the role of the training *method* from the training *data*, or the generation *format* from the model weights.

Two questions remain open: (1) does the diversity collapse co-vary with the post-training method or with the post-training data composition, and (2) does the CoT format itself constrain diversity at inference, or is the collapse embedded in the model weights?

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x1.png)

Figure 1: Study design. We trace output diversity through three parallel post-training lineages of Olmo 3, to identify where, why, and how much diversity is lost.

We answer these questions through a controlled experimental setting (Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). We monitor the output diversity of the open weight and data Olmo 3 model family (olmo2025olmo3), which releases checkpoints of all post-training stages across three parallel lines. Think and Instruct variants share the same post-training recipe (SFT→\toDPO→\toRL) but differ in data, while RL-Zero bypasses SFT and DPO entirely. Evaluating 13 models across 15 tasks with four diversity metrics, we show that the same post-training method produces different diversity outcomes depending on the upstream data composition, and that each stage plays a distinct role. Our contributions:

* •

  We compare Think vs. Instruct lineages, showing that collapse location depends on data: narrow CoT distillation for Think models is associated with a larger drop at SFT, while the DPO drop is larger in Instruct models (§[4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"));
* •

  We evaluate Think models with CoT suppressed at inference and find no diversity recovery on any task–stage combinations, while quality drops. Diversity collapse resides in the model weights, not in the CoT generation format (§[4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Think-not-thinking: CoT as reliability, not diversity ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"));
* •

  We decompose diversity reduction into a quality-control component (removal of incorrect outputs) and a residual component (genuine narrowing among correct outputs), showing the split is task-dependent (§[4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")).

The reliability–diversity tradeoff in post-training.
jiang2025hivemind show that aligned models exhibit high output homogeneity across a wide range of model families and scales. kirk2024understanding find that RLHF reduces both per input and across input diversity. Human co-writing with aligned models reduces content diversity (padmakumar2024writing), and users brainstorming with ChatGPT produce less semantically distinct ideas (anderson2024homogenization). In reasoning, SFT improves pass@1 but degrades pass@kk (dang2025diversity); base models outperform RLVR-trained models at large sample budgets (yue2025does), and base models produce more diverse outputs (west2025base). peeperkorn2025mindgapconformativedecoding identified DPO as the steepest drop. karouzos2026empirical show that under domain shift the adaptation strategy dominates the alignment objective. Current methods cannot selectively preserve diversity where it is beneficial (jain2025task). Quality-adjusted diversity shows that preference-tuned models retain higher diversity among high-quality outputs (shypula2025evaluating), and multi-dimensional linguistic benchmarks find that larger models are often less diverse than smaller ones (guo-etal-2025-benchmarking-linguistic). Automatic diversity metrics lag behind human judgments (tevet-berant-2021-evaluating), and sampling temperature cannot recover training-induced loss (verine2025improving).

Mechanisms and mitigations.
DPO’s gradient imbalance suppresses dispreferred responses (ma2025gradient), and likelihood displacement shifts probability to unintended outputs (razin2025unintentional).
KL-regularized RL specifies unimodal targets by construction (gxchen2025kl), preference collapse arises from KL amplification (xiao2024preference), and chat templates induce diversity collapse (yun-etal-2025-price). Training on recursively generated synthetic data causes progressive tail disappearance (shumailov2024model). Proposed mitigations include forward-KL optimization (wang2024beyond), entropy-constrained RL (pan2026qempo), decoupled regularization (slocum2025diverse), game-theoretic SFT (li2025preserving), diversity-aware preference optimization (li2025darling; lanchantin2025divpo), and conformative decoding (peeperkorn2025mindgapconformativedecoding). A single reward function is insufficient to represent diverse human preferences (chakraborty2024maxmin).

## 3 Experimental setup

### 3.1 Models and training lineages

We study 13 Olmo 3 checkpoints at the 7B scale. Post-training applies up to three stages, SFT, DPO, and RL, starting from the same base model.

Base (1 model). The base model is pretrained on Dolma 3 Mix (6T tokens), midtrained on Dolmino Mix (100B tokens), and context-extended to 65K tokens.

Think (3 models: Think-SFT, Think-DPO, Think). SFT trains on ∼{\sim}2.3M synthetic CoT (wei2022chain) reasoning traces using (prompt, completion) pairs from two teachers: QwQ-32B (qwq32b) and DeepSeek-R1 (deepseek2025r1). DPO uses ∼{\sim}200K Delta Learning (geng2025deltalearning) pairs. The RL stage uses a variation of GRPO (shao2024deepseekmath) with verifiable rewards and no KL penalty, and trains on ∼{\sim}105K prompts, to produce Think.

Think-not-thinking. To isolate the contribution of the CoT generation format from the learned weights, we additionally evaluate all three Think checkpoints with CoT suppressed by prefilling an empty <think>\\backslashn</think>\\backslashn block, forcing direct answers.

Instruct (3 models: Instruct-SFT, Instruct-DPO, Instruct). SFT *initializes from* Think-SFT, then trains on ∼{\sim}2.2M examples that include function-calling, strip reasoning traces, and draw from multiple sources (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4.1; openai2023gpt4) rather than two teachers. DPO (∼{\sim}260K pairs) uses the same pool of prompts as Think-DPO but with the thinking mode disabled, adding multi-turn and GPT-judged preference pairs. The same RL stage as Think produces the final Instruct model.

RL-Zero (6 models). Applies RL training directly to Base, bypassing SFT and DPO. Four Olmo 3 variants target different reward domains: RL-Zero-Math, RL-Zero-Code, RL-Zero-IF, and RL-Zero-General (∼{\sim}105K prompts each). Two additional Olmo 3.1 variants (RL-Zero-Math3.1, RL-Zero-Code3.1) are trained for more steps.

### 3.2 Tasks and Data

Summarization. TL;DR (volske-etal-2017-tl), CNN/DailyMail (nallapati-etal-2016-abstractive), and XSum (narayan-etal-2018-dont). Bounded output length controls for length confounds, and multiple valid summaries provide a clear diversity signal.

Code. HumanEval (chen2021evaluatinglargelanguagemodels), MBPP (austin2021programsynthesislargelanguage), and CRUXEval (gu2024cruxeval). Outputs can be syntactically different but functionally identical, and RL directly optimizes code tasks.

Reasoning. GSM8K (cobbe2021trainingverifierssolvemath), MATH-Algebra, MATH-Geometry (hendrycks2021measuring), and TruthfulQA (lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa), the primary Think and RL-Zero training domain. Diversity here measures variation in solution *strategy* with answers held constant.

Instruction following. Alpaca (alpaca), open-ended, and IFEval (zhou2023ifeval), with verifiable format constraints.

Creative writing. WritingPrompts (fan-etal-2018-hierarchical), where diversity is intrinsically desirable.

Value pluralism. PRISM (kirk2024prism) and WildBench (lin2025wildbench), which test whether alignment imposes a single perspective on contested topics.

We measure training–evaluation overlap using C13C\_{13} 13-gram matching (lambert2025tulu) between the four Dolci post-training datasets and all fifteen evaluation tasks (Appendix [J](#A10 "Appendix J Decontamination ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). Nine datasets show negligible overlap (≤ 2%{\leq}\,2\%). HumanEval, CRUXEval, IFEval, MATH-Algebra, MATH-Geometry, and WildBench show elevated overlap (7–30%), traceable to shared upstream data. While we flag these benchmarks, our findings on contaminated tasks are consistent with the patterns on the clean tasks.

### 3.3 Metrics

We measure diversity along four complementary axes (detailed definitions in Appendix [B](#A2 "Appendix B Metric definitions ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). EAD (liu-etal-2022-rethinking) counts unique nn-grams normalized against the expected count under a uniform draw (averaged over n∈{1,…,5}n\in\{1,\dots,5\}), capturing *lexical* diversity. SBERT computes mean pairwise cosine distance of sentence embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2; reimers-gurevych-2019-sentence), capturing *semantic* diversity (0 = collapse, 1 = dissimilar). For code tasks we additionally report *semantic* diversity with UniXcoder (guo2022unixcoder) embeddings (Appendix [F](#A6 "Appendix F Code-specific diversity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). NLI scores output pairs with an NLI classifier (roberta-large-mnli; liu2019robertarobustlyoptimizedbert), following stasaski-hearst-2022-semantic, capturing *logical* diversity; code tasks are excluded. Vendi Score (friedman2023the) measures the effective number of dissimilar outputs via eigenvalue entropy of the SBERT similarity kernel (VS=1{=}1: identical, VS=K{=}K: orthogonal). For code-generation tasks we also report AST subtree diversity, the mean pairwise Jaccard distance on AST subtree multisets  (shypula2025evaluating), on correct outputs only (Appendix [F](#A6 "Appendix F Code-specific diversity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")).

Quality. For the six tasks with verifiable answers (GSM8K, MATH-Algebra, MATH-Geometry, HumanEval, MBPP, IFEval), we report: accuracy@1 (greedy decoding), majority vote@16 (most frequent answer among K=16K{=}16 samples), and pass@16 (at least one correct among KK). For code tasks we use the unbiased pass@kk estimator. For IFEval we report strict and loose constraint satisfaction. For the eight tasks without verifiable answers we evaluate quality using LLM-as-judge (gpt-4.1-mini) with established protocols (Appendix [D](#A4 "Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")).

Quality-filtered diversity. We decompose diversity into a quality-control component (removal of incorrect outputs) and a residual component (genuine narrowing among correct outputs). DaD\_{a} (SBERT on all KK outputs) and DcD\_{c} (SBERT on the Kc≥2K\_{c}\geq 2 correct outputs). The gap Da−DcD\_{a}-D\_{c} reflects diversity from error variety; DcD\_{c} captures genuine narrowing among correct solutions. We report analogous Vendi scores VaV\_{a} and VcV\_{c}.

For each model–task pair, we generate K=16K{=}16 outputs per prompt at T=0.6T{=}0.6, top-p=0.95p{=}0.95. Base recommends T=1.0T{=}1.0; we use matched settings for controlled comparison (Appendix [H](#A8 "Appendix H Temperature sensitivity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). For all Think-lineage models, we strip <think>...</think> reasoning traces before computing any metric, so that all diversity and quality scores reflect the *final answer* only. Implementation details are in Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A Implementation details ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?").

## 4 Results

We present results around three questions. First, *where* does diversity collapse along each lineage (§[4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"); Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"), Table [1](#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"))? Second, does the CoT generation format itself constrain diversity (§[4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Think-not-thinking: CoT as reliability, not diversity ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"); Figures [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")–[5](#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Think-not-thinking: CoT as reliability, not diversity ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"))? Third, how much of the observed collapse is attributable to quality control (§[4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"); Figures [7](#S4.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")–[8](#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 4.4 Cross-cutting patterns ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"))?

### 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x2.png)

Figure 2: SBERT, EAD, and Vendi Score across post-training stages. Think (orange) collapses at SFT; Instruct (blue) at DPO. Think w/o CoT (hollow) tracks Think.

SFT asymmetry. Think and Instruct share the same three-stage post-training, yet collapse at different stages. Think-SFT loses 62% (Table [1](#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) of Base diversity on average, 24% more than Instruct-SFT (38%), uniformly across all 15 tasks, consistent with *completion homogeneity* from two teachers rather than prompt overlap. This challenges findings of minimal SFT impact on diversity (guo-etal-2025-benchmarking-linguistic) and suggests that the effect depends on the breadth of the SFT data. Collapse magnitude also scales with task difficulty (Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). Think-SFT retains only 36% of Base diversity on GSM8K (92% accuracy) but 54% on MATH-Geometry (50% accuracy). Easier tasks with a dominant solution strategy collapse the most. Instruct-SFT, despite initializing from the already-collapsed Think-SFT, recovers a median 40% of the lost diversity, likely due to its multi-source data. As Instruct-SFT initializes from Think-SFT, this recovery also reflects the dynamics of retraining a collapsed model.

|  | SFT | DPO | RL | Retained |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Think | −-62 | −-4 | ++4 | 38% |
| Instruct | −-38 | −-23 | −-5 | 34% |
| RL-Zero | (single) | | | 93% |

Table 1: Stage-wise SBERT loss (% of Base, 15-task average).

DPO asymmetry. DPO erases more diversity in Instruct than in Think, as Think has already collapsed at SFT, leaving little for DPO to remove. The effect is largest on summarization and code-reasoning tasks, where Instruct-SFT had preserved substantial diversity. On three math/code tasks, Think-DPO actually *increases* diversity slightly, and Instruct-DPO does the same on GSM8K, suggesting that DPO can partially correct a collapsed SFT distribution.

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x3.png)

Figure 3: NLI diversity.

RL reversal. Think’s RL stage increases semantic diversity on most tasks, primarily code and summarization. The recovery is modest (roughly 5% of total diversity lost) but directionally consistent. Both lineages use the same RLVR method, so the asymmetry likely reflects the input state: Think enters RL already at its diversity floor, leaving room for exploration, while Instruct enters with residual diversity that RL continues to compress. On GSM8K, Instruct RL erases 37% of Base diversity, the largest single-stage loss outside SFT, as the verifiable reward concentrates probability on the dominant correct strategy. The RLVR stage also produces lexically *more uniform* outputs (EAD decreases on nearly all tasks), suggesting it standardizes surface form while broadening semantic content.

Convergence. RL-Zero bypasses both bottlenecks (Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")), retaining ≥71%\geq 71\% of Base diversity (median 94%). Both supervised lineages converge to similar final diversity floors (with Think slightly higher on 11/15 tasks), despite different trajectories: data composition co-varies with *when* and *how sharply* diversity is lost. Table [1](#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") summarizes the stage-wise attribution. Full per-task breakdowns are in Appendix [I](#A9 "Appendix I Stage attribution per task ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?").

The collapse is semantic, not lexical (Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). Per input SBERT drops from 0.32 (Base) to 0.12 (Think) and 0.11 (Instruct), and the Vendi Score drops from ∼{\sim}3.4 effective modes to ∼{\sim}1.8 (final), with near-total collapse on math (GSM8K: 1.3 modes, MATH-Algebra: 1.4), 16 samples carry essentially no more semantic diversity than one. EAD (Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) remains stable or *increases*, even as semantic diversity drops. Aligned models use varied vocabulary and phrasing to express semantically identical content. Think’s EAD on WritingPrompts rises from 0.23 to 0.80, while SBERT falls from 0.54 to 0.20, a pattern replicated across open-ended tasks. For natural language tasks, NLI diversity (Figure [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) drops on most tasks, though the gap varies. Post-trained models still make logically distinct claims. The gap is largest for Think models, where CoT reasoning preserves logical structure even as the surface distribution narrows.

Value-pluralism tasks suffer the steepest Think collapse (PRISM −78%-78\%, TruthfulQA −79%-79\%), as narrow two-teacher distillation cannot represent the range of perspectives these tasks require. On PRISM, Think’s NLI (Figure [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) scores remain above 1.0 (net contradictions), meaning the model still samples contradictions despite converged phrasing, though we cannot determine whether this is genuine stance plurality or internal incoherence. Instruct drops NLI below 1.0, indicating homogenization of both form and stance (Figure [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). Think’s NLI remains above the contradiction threshold on value-pluralism and creative tasks where Instruct’s drops below.
Creative writing (WritingPrompts) shows the highest Base diversity (6.9 Vendi modes) and the sharpest quality–diversity tension. Think and Instruct both collapse to ∼{\sim}0.20 SBERT and ∼{\sim}2.6 modes (−63%-63\%), yet achieve >{>}97% pairwise win rate against Base, producing better stories at the cost of formulaic variation. RL-Zero retains ∼{\sim}100% of Base diversity, but wins only ∼{\sim}50%, consistent with the absence of a creative-writing reward signal. NLI diversity remains above 1.0 for all models on WritingPrompts (Think 1.12, Instruct 1.02, RL-Zero 1.15), meaning post-trained models still produce logically distinct narratives despite semantic convergence. Full per-task breakdowns are in Appendix [C](#A3 "Appendix C Per-task diversity results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?").

### 4.2 Think-not-thinking: CoT as reliability, not diversity

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x5.png)

Figure 5: WildBench Score.

Think and Instruct differ in both training data *and* generation format. Think generates CoT reasoning traces before answering, while Instruct answers directly. To isolate the format’s contribution, we evaluate all three Think models with CoT suppressed, we refer to these models as *Think-not-thinking*. This is an out-of-distribution intervention, so we interpret the results as testing whether format removal recover diversity. Across tasks (Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")), removing CoT  does not recover diversity. Think-not-thinking SBERT diversity matches Think, and Instruct shows similarly collapsed diversity. This holds at every stage (SFT, DPO, RLVR) and across every task category. IFEval shows a small increase (+0.025+0.025 SBERT), but this is modest relative to the Base-to-Think gap (−0.153-0.153).

CoT suppression *does* affect accuracy (Figure [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")), with harder tasks losing more: IFEval −8%-8\%, GSM8K −18%-18\%, MBPP −20%-20\%, MATH-Algebra −28%-28\%, HumanEval −32%-32\%, MATH-Geometry −32%-32\%. The quality cost is task-dependent (Figure [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")), CoT suppression is negligible for open-ended generation (no change for Alpaca, WritingPrompts −4%-4\%) but severe for summarization (CNN/DM −48%-48\%) and complex helpfulness (WildBench Score 4.6→1.44.6\to 1.4, Figure [5](#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Think-not-thinking: CoT as reliability, not diversity ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). In no case does suppression recover diversity. CoT improves reliability by helping the model execute its learned strategy, especially on hard problems, without broadening the answer-level diversity distribution. The output distribution is equally collapsed whether the model reasons explicitly or answers directly. One exception is WritingPrompts, where removing CoTs slightly *increases* SBERT diversity (+0.046+0.046), suggesting that CoT imposes implicit narrative templates that constrain story generation. NLI diversity reveals a subtler pattern on math tasks: Think-not-thinking produces *higher* NLI scores than Think (GSM8K: 0.87 vs. 0.70; MATH-Algebra: 0.91 vs. 0.73), despite identical SBERT. Without CoT, final answers are semantically collapsed but logically less entailing. The model generates diverse wrong answers rather than diverse correct strategies, consistent with the accuracy drops.

Diversity collapse resides in the learned distribution, not the output format. Narrow two-teacher SFT data reshapes model outputs, and this effect is not reversed by suppressing CoT at inference. This aligns with findings that CoT in post-trained models can function as post-hoc rationalization (lewislim2025cot) and that CoT can be applied selectively (sprague2025to). The model has already converged on its answer distribution during training. The Think vs Instruct comparison (§[4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) is, therefore, not confounded by the generation format. The diversity difference between lineages reflects data composition. Practitioners cannot recover diversity by switching Think models to direct-answer mode, the cost is paid at training time. We note that we measure final-answer diversity, not reasoning-path diversity.

### 4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x6.png)

Figure 6: Quality filtered Vendi Score on six verifiable tasks.

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x7.png)

Figure 7: Code diversity on correct outputs: AST subtree Jaccard (structural) and UniXcoder (semantic) for HumanEval and MBPP.

The aggregate diversity reductions combine two effects, elimination of incorrect outputs and genuine narrowing of the correct-answer distribution (Figure [7](#S4.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). We decompose these using DaD\_{a}, DcD\_{c}, VaV\_{a} and VcV\_{c} on six verifiable tasks (GSM8K, MATH-Algebra, MATH-Geometry, HumanEval, MBPP, IFEval). All models achieve 94–97% pass@16 on GSM8K, the underlying capability is broadly present. RL-Zero variants also reach 94–97% pass@16 on GSM8K despite 49–61% accuracy@1, confirming the gap is in reliability, not capability. The difference lies in per-attempt reliability (Think 93% vs. Base 56%), not in whether the knowledge exists.

The proportion of collapse attributable to quality control varies by task (Figure [7](#S4.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"); Appendix [E](#A5 "Appendix E Quality-filtered diversity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")): on IFEval, 83.4% of the DaD\_{a} drop persists in DcD\_{c} (genuine narrowing), while on MBPP 38% is genuine and on HumanEval less than 10%. Math reasoning falls between (57–64% genuine). Code-specific metrics sharpen this picture: among correct HumanEval outputs, Think produces structurally homogeneous solutions (AST Jaccard =0.53{=}0.53, UniXcoder Dc=0.13D\_{c}{=}0.13) while Base/RL-Zero’s correct outputs are structurally diverse (AST Jaccard =0.89{=}0.89 on MBPP; Figure [7](#S4.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Quality-filtered diversity decomposition ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")). This resolves the tension between diversity collapse is harmful and it is just quality control (lake2025overton): both are right, in task-dependent proportions.

Even among correct outputs, a narrowing persists: Base maintains 1.7 effective Vendi modes among its ∼{\sim}8.5/16 correct answers, while both Think and Instruct converge to 1.3–1.6 modes among their correct answers (∼{\sim}15/16 for GSM8K), while IFEval is higher at 2.1–2.3. In absolute terms, all post-trained models produce near-homogeneous correct outputs, which limits the effectiveness of majority voting (wang2023selfconsistency): Think gains just +0.4% on GSM8K (16 near-identical correct answers provide no independent signal), while Base gains +24% and RL-Zero +22–26%. Correct-answer diversity determines how much models benefit from repeated sampling (snell2025scaling). On MATH-Algebra, Think-not-thinking and RL-Zero-Math both achieve ∼{\sim}49% accuracy, but RL-Zero-Math has twice the correct-answer diversity and gains +15% from majority voting compared to +7% for Think-not-thinking. The pattern holds across math tasks (Figure [8](#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 4.4 Cross-cutting patterns ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")): at matched accuracy, models with more diverse correct outputs consistently extract more benefit from sampling.

On HumanEval, Instruct surpasses Think at pass@16 (98.2 vs. 95.7) despite trailing at pass@1 (81.2 vs. 87.7). The collapsed output distribution means additional samples yield identical solutions. On TruthfulQA, the effect is reversed, majority-voting actually *hurts* all models (majority vote@16 << accuracy@1), because the model converges confidently onto the misconception the question was designed to test. When the dominant mode is wrong, diversity collapse amplifies the error. Figure [8](#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 4.4 Cross-cutting patterns ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") visualizes this pattern, high-accuracy models cluster near zero MV gain, while lower-accuracy models with diverse correct outputs benefit substantially. Full quality results are in Appendix [D](#A4 "Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?"); quality-filtered results in Appendix [E](#A5 "Appendix E Quality-filtered diversity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?").

### 4.4 Cross-cutting patterns

!(/html/2604.16027/assets/x8.png)

Figure 8: Accuracy@1 vs. majority-voting gain.

The ordering (Base >> RL-Zero >> Final) holds on average across all 15 tasks, though individual RL-Zero variants exceed Base on tasks aligned with their reward signal (e.g., RL-Zero-IF on IFEval, RL-Zero-Code3.1 on HumanEval). A model that is low-diversity on one task tends to be low-diversity on all tasks. Output length does not explain diversity ordering (Appendix [G](#A7 "Appendix G Output length analysis ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")).

LLM-as-a-judge evaluation (Figure [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) confirms post-training improves quality across all non-verified task categories. CNN/DM and XSum win rates increase from 26–48% (Base) to 83–95% (Think, Instruct), open-ended pairwise win rates exceed 80% for Think on Alpaca and for both Think and Instruct on PRISM. WildBench scores rise from −2.0-2.0 (Base) to 6.16.1 (Instruct). RL-Zero models are tied with Base on WritingPrompts (50% win rate), consistent with the absence of creative-writing reward signals. Diversity reductions coexist with clear quality gains.

Among RL-Zero variants, the reward signal type predicts diversity preservation. RL-Zero-IF (instruction-following rewards) retains 99% of Base diversity on average, while RL-Zero-Code retains only 88%. On code tasks specifically, RL-Zero-Code retains *less* diversity (90%) than RL-Zero-General (100%). Pass/fail execution rewards narrow the solution space more aggressively than general rewards. Mathematical reasoning rewards, which admit diverse solution paths, fall between these extremes. This order (format rewards >> math rewards >> code rewards) shows that the reward specificity predicts diversity reduction. However, RL-Zero’s diversity advantage comes at a steep quality cost, the RL-Zero range is 49.8-61.0% on GSM8K (vs. 93% Think, 80% Instruct) and 49% on IFEval (vs. 79% Think).

## 5 Discussion

Data composition co-varies with the trajectory, not the floor.
Think and Instruct share the same three-stage training yet collapse at different stages. The DPO asymmetry (§[4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Lineage-dependent diversity collapse ‣ 4 Results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")) reflects the upstream SFT state more than DPO data differences. Think collapses uniformly across all tasks at SFT, leaving DPO little to remove, while Instruct enters DPO with residual spread that is aggressively narrowed.
Despite these different paths, both lineages converge to 1.3–1.6 Vendi modes among correct answers on most verifiable tasks and ∼{\sim}2 modes overall, with IFEval as an outlier at 2.1–2.3. Data composition determines *when* and *how sharply* models reach the diversity floor, but not the floor itself. This distinction matters practically, data-level interventions (more teachers, broader sources) can slow the descent but may not raise the final diversity level. Algorithmic changes, switching from reverse to forward KL (wang2024beyond), adding entropy constraints (pan2026qempo), or removing KL penalties entirely (as in RL-Zero), appear necessary to shift the floor. For SFT data, this suggests that the number of distinct completion sources matters. Practitioners should avoid single-teacher or dual-teacher distillation when output diversity is valued, and instead draw from multiple models with diverse training.

Mechanistic interpretation.
SFT via cross-entropy loss on narrow data performs maximum-likelihood estimation on a low-entropy target distribution. As two teachers from related training lineages produce completions occupying a restricted region of the output space, the model reproduces this narrow mixture. DPO’s reverse-KL objective is mode-seeking by construction, its gradient is proportional to the implicit reward gap between chosen and rejected outputs. When the model is already collapsed (Think post-SFT), chosen and rejected responses are both near the mode, yielding small gradients and minimal further compression. When the model retains spread (Instruct post-SFT), DPO aggressively downweights the tails. GRPO *without KL regularization* frees the policy to rediscover modes that SFT and DPO suppressed, provided they receive a positive reward signal.

Task-dependent patterns: where diversity loss matters most.
On math and reasoning tasks a significant part of diversity reduction reflects removal of incorrect solution paths, as the narrowing among correct outputs is modest. On code tasks, less collapse is genuine narrowing, but it still limits pass@kk scaling. Summarization shows the largest semantic diversity loss, but this is the cost for large quality gains. Creative writing and value-pluralism are the tasks where the observed diversity loss risks imposing a single perspective. The pattern that emerges is a spectrum, from tasks where collapse is largely helpful (code correctness filtering) to tasks where it is actively harmful (value-laden open-ended generation). Practitioners should assess diversity impact relative to their task characteristics, when selecting post-trained models or applying uniform post-training recipes.

From distributional to representational diversity.
We capture *distributional* diversity, i.e. statistical spread along lexical, semantic, and logical axes. This is not a sufficient condition for *representational* diversity, the presence of outputs reflecting different perspectives or stances. We detect when a model’s output distribution narrows but cannot determine which perspectives are lost. The distinction matters most on value-pluralism tasks. Narrow training data does not just reduce variation, it risks imposing a single perspective on questions where legitimate disagreement exists. A model could maintain high distributional diversity while eliminating viewpoints, or conversely appear collapsed while preserving the stances that matter most. Targeted probes for representational diversity across demographic and cultural dimensions are needed to close this gap.

## 6 Conclusion

We traced output diversity through three parallel post-training lineages of Olmo 3, showing that diversity collapse is shaped by training data composition, not the post-training method alone. The same three-stage recipe (SFT→\toDPO→\toRL) produces different collapse trajectories depending on the upstream data: narrow two-teacher distillation drives a steep SFT cliff, while broader multi-source data shifts the sharpest drop to DPO. Suppressing the CoT generation format at inference costs accuracy, but does not recover diversity, confirming that the collapse resides in the learned weights. Decomposing the diversity loss into quality-control and residual components reveals a task-dependent split. On some tasks nearly all narrowing reflects the removal of errors, on others most of it is genuine homogenization among correct outputs. This directly affects inference scaling and majority voting boosts. For practitioners, our results point to two actionable directions: (1) broadening the source distribution for SFT data (more teachers, more styles) can mitigate the steepest collapse, and (2) RL without KL penalties can partially reverse DPO-induced semantic narrowing, though the effect is modest. Future work should investigate reasoning-path diversity (as distinct from final-answer diversity), test data-composition interventions directly, and examine whether the diversity floor we observe can be lowered by changes to the preference-optimization objective.

## Appendix A Implementation details

We generate outputs using vLLM (kwon2023efficient) and lighteval (lighteval). For each model–task pair, we sample K=16K{=}16 outputs per prompt (N=500N{=}500 prompts; full dataset for Math-Geometry, IFEval, HumanEval, and TruthfulQA) with a 32,768-token generation length. All four diversity metrics (EAD, SBERT, NLI, Vendi Score) operate on the same post-stripping text. Table [2](#A1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Appendix A Implementation details ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") lists all evaluation tasks with their sample sizes.

## Appendix B Metric definitions

For a given prompt, the model generates KK outputs {o1,…,oK}\{o\_{1},\ldots,o\_{K}\}. All metrics are computed per prompt and then averaged over prompts.

EAD (lexical diversity)

Expectation-Adjusted Distinct nn-grams (liu-etal-2022-rethinking) counts the number of unique nn-grams in the output set, normalized by the expected number of unique nn-grams under a uniform draw from a vocabulary of size VV. For a total of TT nn-gram tokens with UU unique types,
EADn=UV⋅(1−(V−1V)T),\text{EAD}\_{n}=\frac{U}{V\cdot\left(1-\left(\frac{V-1}{V}\right)^{T}\right)}\,,
where VV is auto-detected from the model’s tokenizer vocabulary. The denominator corrects for length bias: longer outputs are expected to contain more unique nn-grams by chance. We average across n∈{1,…,5}n\in\{1,\ldots,5\} and clip to [0,1][0,1]:
DEAD=15​∑n=15EADn.D\_{\text{EAD}}=\frac{1}{5}\sum\_{n=1}^{5}\text{EAD}\_{n}\,.

SBERT (semantic diversity)

We encode each output oio\_{i} with all-mpnet-base-v2 (reimers-gurevych-2019-sentence) to obtain L2-normalized embeddings 𝐞i\mathbf{e}\_{i}. Semantic diversity is the mean pairwise cosine distance:
DSBERT=1−2K​(K−1)​∑i<jcos⁡(𝐞i,𝐞j).D\_{\text{SBERT}}=1-\frac{2}{K(K-1)}\sum\_{i<j}\cos(\mathbf{e}\_{i},\mathbf{e}\_{j})\,.
Values near 0 indicate semantic collapse (all outputs map to the same region of embedding space); values near 1 indicate highly dissimilar outputs. For code tasks we additionally report diversity using UniXcoder (guo2022unixcoder), a code-aware encoder that captures structural similarity beyond surface tokens.

NLI (logical diversity)

Following stasaski-hearst-2022-semantic, we score output pairs with a natural language inference classifier (roberta-large-mnli; liu2019robertarobustlyoptimizedbert). For each ordered pair (oi,oj)(o\_{i},o\_{j}), the model predicts a probability distribution over {entailment, neutral, contradiction}. We compute a directional similarity score as P​(entailment)−P​(contradiction)P(\text{entailment})-P(\text{contradiction}), then symmetrize by averaging both orderings:
si​j=12​[(Pent​(oi∣oj)−Pcon​(oi∣oj))+(Pent​(oj∣oi)−Pcon​(oj∣oi))].s\_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\bigl[\bigl(P\_{\text{ent}}(o\_{i}\mid o\_{j})-P\_{\text{con}}(o\_{i}\mid o\_{j})\bigr)+\bigl(P\_{\text{ent}}(o\_{j}\mid o\_{i})-P\_{\text{con}}(o\_{j}\mid o\_{i})\bigr)\bigr]\,.
Since NLI models are trained on single sentences rather than full paragraphs, we align sentences by position across outputs. The diversity score is:
DNLI=1−2K​(K−1)​∑i<jsi​j.D\_{\text{NLI}}=1-\frac{2}{K(K-1)}\sum\_{i<j}s\_{ij}\,.
DNLID\_{\text{NLI}} near 0 indicates mutual entailment (collapse), near 1 indicates neutrality, and values above 1 indicate net contradiction (the outputs make mutually inconsistent claims). Code tasks are excluded as NLI is not meaningful for program text.

Vendi Score

The Vendi Score (friedman2023the) measures the effective number of dissimilar elements via the eigenvalue entropy of a similarity kernel. We reuse the SBERT cosine similarity matrix. Given KK outputs with L2-normalized embeddings, we form the Gram matrix 𝐆\mathbf{G} where Gi​j=cos⁡(𝐞i,𝐞j)G\_{ij}=\cos(\mathbf{e}\_{i},\mathbf{e}\_{j}) and trace-normalize it as 𝐏=𝐆/K\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{G}/K. The Vendi Score is
VS=exp⁡(−∑iλi​log⁡λi),\text{VS}=\exp\!\left(-\sum\_{i}\lambda\_{i}\log\lambda\_{i}\right),
where λi\lambda\_{i} are the eigenvalues of 𝐏\mathbf{P}. VS=1{=}1 when all outputs are identical (rank-1 kernel) and VS=K{=}K when all outputs are orthogonal (full-rank uniform spectrum). Because the Vendi Score shares the SBERT kernel, agreement between VS and DSBERTD\_{\text{SBERT}} is expected rather than independent confirmation; VS adds the interpretable “effective number of modes” framing.

AST subtree diversity (structural, code only)

For code-generation tasks (HumanEval, MBPP), we measure structural diversity via the mean pairwise Jaccard distance on AST subtree multisets (subtree height ≤4\leq 4; shypula2025evaluating). We parse each output into a Python AST, extract all subtrees up to height 4, represent each output as a multiset of subtree hashes, and compute
DAST​(oi,oj)=1−|Si∩Sj||Si∪Sj|,D\_{\text{AST}}(o\_{i},o\_{j})=1-\frac{|S\_{i}\cap S\_{j}|}{|S\_{i}\cup S\_{j}|}\,,
where SiS\_{i} is the multiset of subtree hashes for output oio\_{i}. This metric is reported on correct (executable, test-passing) outputs only, to capture genuine structural variation among working solutions. Unparseable outputs are excluded.

LLM-as-a-Judge quality

For the eight tasks without verifiable answers, we evaluate quality using established LLM-as-judge frameworks with gpt-4.1-mini via the OpenAI Batch API. *Summarization* (TL;DR, CNN/DM, XSum): pairwise win-rate against reference summaries, following kirk2024understanding. *Instruction following and value pluralism* (Alpaca, PRISM): pairwise comparison against Base using MT-Bench prompts (zheng2023judging). *Creative writing* (WritingPrompts): pairwise comparison using Arena-Hard creative writing prompts (li2024arenahard). *WildBench*: checklist-guided WB-Score (lin2025wildbench).
We note that LLM-judge evaluation of creative and value-laden tasks has known limitations (lu2026rethinking); we report these results as supplementary context for our diversity findings rather than as primary evidence.

## Appendix D Quality results

Tables [7](#A4.T7 "Table 7 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?")–[13](#A4.T13 "Table 13 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") report task performance for all 16 models, across all 15 tasks. Table [7](#A4.T7 "Table 7 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports reasoning quality on four tasks (GSM8K, MATH-Algebra, MATH-Geometry, TruthfulQA) with accuracy@1, majority vote@16, and pass@16. Table [8](#A4.T8 "Table 8 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports code generation quality (pass@kk for k∈{1,5,10,16}k\in\{1,5,10,16\}) on HumanEval and MBPP. Table [9](#A4.T9 "Table 9 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports IFEval constraint satisfaction with strict and loose accuracy@1, pass@16, and consistency@16. Table [10](#A4.T10 "Table 10 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports CruxEval output-prediction accuracy.

For tasks without verifiable answers, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation with gpt-4.1-mini via the OpenAI Batch API. Table [11](#A4.T11 "Table 11 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports pairwise win rates against reference summaries following kirk2024understanding. Table [12](#A4.T12 "Table 12 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports pairwise win rates against the Base model using the MT-Bench prompt (zheng2023judging) for Alpaca and PRISM and the Arena-Hard creative writing prompt (li2024arenahard) for WritingPrompts. Table [13](#A4.T13 "Table 13 ‣ Appendix D Quality results ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports checklist-guided WB-Score (lin2025wildbench). We note that LLM-judge evaluation of creative and value-laden tasks has known limitations (lu2026rethinking); we report these results as supplementary context for our diversity findings rather than as primary evidence.

## Appendix E Quality-filtered diversity

Table [14](#A5.T14 "Table 14 ‣ Appendix E Quality-filtered diversity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports the quality-filtered diversity decomposition defined in §[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Metrics ‣ 3 Experimental setup ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") for six verifiable tasks. We label each of K=16K{=}16 generations as correct or incorrect (answer matching for math, test execution for code, constraint satisfaction for IFEval), then report accuracy alongside DaD\_{a} (SBERT on all outputs), DcD\_{c} (SBERT on correct-only subset, Kc≥2K\_{c}\geq 2), and VcV\_{c} (Vendi Score on correct outputs, interpreted as the effective number of distinct correct answers).

## Appendix G Output length analysis

Table [16](#A7.T16 "Table 16 ‣ Appendix G Output length analysis ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports the mean output word length and mean SBERT diversity per task, averaged across all 13 models. Tasks with high mean diversity (e.g. WritingPrompts, HumanEval) span a wide range of output lengths, and tasks with similar lengths (e.g. GSM8K at 137 words, TruthfulQA at 142 words) have very different diversity levels (0.128 vs. 0.262). Output length does not systematically predict diversity.

## Appendix H Temperature sensitivity

Table [17](#A8.T17 "Table 17 ‣ Appendix H Temperature sensitivity ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") compares Base model diversity at its recommended sampling temperature (T=1.0T{=}1.0, top-p=0.7p{=}0.7) with the matched temperature used throughout this study (T=0.6T{=}0.6, top-p=0.95p{=}0.95). SBERT diversity decreases by 11% on average, EAD by 18%, and NLI by only 3%. These reductions are modest relative to the 62% SBERT drop from Base to Think-SFT, confirming that the diversity gaps documented in this paper are not attributable to the temperature difference.

## Appendix I Stage attribution per task

Table [18](#A9.T18 "Table 18 ‣ Appendix I Stage attribution per task ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports the percentage of Base SBERT diversity lost at each post-training stage for all 15 tasks. Think collapses 45–80% at SFT (most on XSum, least on IFEval), with DPO contributing minimally. Instruct shows the opposite pattern: SFT losses range from 8–73%, but DPO contributes 2–63% additional loss. RL-Zero retains 71–105% of Base diversity across tasks.

## Appendix J Decontamination

We measure training–evaluation data overlap using C13C\_{13} 13-gram matching (lambert2025tulu): for each test instance, we extract all 13-grams (tokenized with spaCy), query an Elasticsearch index of the training data for phrase matches, and report the fraction of test tokens covered by at least one matching 13-gram, averaged over all test instances.
Table [19](#A10.T19 "Table 19 ‣ Appendix J Decontamination ‣ Where does output diversity collapse in post-training?") reports results for the four Dolci post-training datasets against all fifteen evaluation benchmarks.
Summarization, creative writing, open-ended QA, and value-pluralism benchmarks show negligible overlap (≤ 1.6%{\leq}\,1.6\%).
HumanEval, CRUXEval, IFEval, MATH, and WildBench show elevated overlap (7–30%), traceable to shared upstream sources: the Dolci SFT mixes include OpenThoughts3 (guha2025openthoughtsdatarecipesreasoning), whose math questions derive from OpenMathInstruct-2 (toshniwal2024openmath2), itself built on the MATH training set, large-scale Python corpora, Dolci-Think-Python (olmo2025olmo3), Nemotron (nvidia\_nemotron\_nano\_v3\_2025) code split, and WildChat conversations (zhao2024wildchat).
