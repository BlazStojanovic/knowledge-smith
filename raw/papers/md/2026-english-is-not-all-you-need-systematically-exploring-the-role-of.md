###### Abstract

Despite the widespread multilingual deployment of large language models, post-training pipelines remain predominantly English-centric, contributing to performance disparities across languages. We present a systematic, controlled study of the interplay between training language coverage, model scale, and task domain, based on 220 supervised fine-tuning runs on parallel translated multilingual data mixtures spanning mathematical reasoning and API calling tasks, with models up to 8B parameters. We find that increasing language coverage during post-training is largely beneficial across tasks and model scales, with low-resource languages benefiting the most and high-resource languages plateauing rather than degrading. Even minimal multilinguality helps: incorporating a single non-English language improves both English performance and cross-lingual generalization, making English-only post-training largely suboptimal. Moreover, at sufficient language diversity, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer can match or exceed the effects of direct language inclusion in a low-diversity setting, although gains remain limited for typologically distant, low-resource languages.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of tasks, driven by capabilities such as reasoning, instruction following, and structured generation. These capabilities are largely enabled by a multi-stage pipeline of large-scale pre-training followed by post-training on curated datasets (Shaham et al., [2024](#bib.bib16)). Despite growing global use of LLMs, post-training remains predominantly English-centric. While task-specific English fine-tuning enables some degree of cross-lingual transfer, significant performance disparities persist across languages (Khanuja et al., [2023](#bib.bib9)).

Prior work on multilingual post-training suggests a nuanced picture: replacing small amounts of English data with a limited number of additional languages can improve multilingual task performance, while larger substitutions often yield diminishing gains and may degrade English performance (Shaham et al., [2024](#bib.bib16); Kew et al., [2024](#bib.bib8)). Similarly, work has shown that augmenting English task-specific data with multilingual data improves multilingual outcomes (Lai & Nissim, [2024](#bib.bib11); Ji & Chen, [2025](#bib.bib6); Shimabucoro et al., [2025](#bib.bib18)).

However, these findings remain fragmented and leave several questions unresolved.
Existing studies typically focus on a narrow set of languages, tasks, and/or model scales, making it difficult to understand how increasing language coverage systematically affects model behavior. In particular, we lack a clear characterization of how trade-offs manifest across (i) English vs. non-English performance, (ii) different task types, and (iii) varying model capacities.
This gap is especially important in light of multilingual pre-training literature, which highlights a fundamental trade-off under fixed model capacity: expanding language coverage can dilute performance in high-resource languages–a phenomenon often termed the “curse of multilinguality” or “negative interference” (Conneau et al., [2020](#bib.bib3); Chang et al., [2024](#bib.bib1); Longpre et al., [2025](#bib.bib13)). While cross-lingual transfer can provide gains, it is still unclear when benefits outweigh interference effects during post-training and how these effects scale with model size and task complexity.

Figure 1: Overview of the experimental design. We start from a task-specific multilingual parallel data pool consisting of five core languages, which are used to construct exhaustive data mixture combinations, and five additional languages that enable scaling the experiments to up to ten languages. We generate 22 data mixtures with increasing language counts and varying combinations; within the multilingual data mixtures, languages shown in blue indicate one possible combination, while languages shown in grey are fixed for the corresponding number of languages. We train five models from two model families on each mixture for two tasks, resulting in 22 × 2 × 5 = 220 total training runs.

We present a systematic study of multilingual task-specific post-training across two tasks, two model families, and 220 training runs. Our controlled scaling design varies multilinguality by increasing the number of languages in the post-training mixture, using parallel translated task data to avoid convolving our results with the effect of simply increasing the dataset size with additional iid data  (Shimabucoro et al., [2025](#bib.bib18); Ji & Chen, [2025](#bib.bib6)).

We train models on mixtures of up to 10 languages (Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training")) using the Qwen-3 family (0.6B, 1.7B, 8B) (Yang et al., [2025](#bib.bib19)) and Gemma-3 (1B, 4B) (Kamath et al., [2025](#bib.bib7)). Evaluation covers mathematical reasoning and API calling across six languages that span different resource levels, language families, regions, and scripts (Table [1](#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Task 2: API Calling ‣ 3.1 Tasks and Datasets ‣ 3 Experimental Details ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training")).

We summarize our key findings as follows:

1. 1.

   Multilingual scaling is largely beneficial across tasks and model scales: increasing language coverage generally improves or maintains performance across tasks and model scales, with low-resource languages continuing to benefit from added multilinguality while high-resource languages plateau rather than degrade.
2. 2.

   Even limited language diversity helps: adding parallel data in even a single non-English language typically results in gains that generalize beyond the added language to other languages, including English, making English-only post-training consistently suboptimal.
3. 3.

   High diversity enables strong zero-shot cross-lingual transfer: increased language diversity during post-training enables strong zero-shot cross-lingual transfer that can match or exceed the effects of direct language inclusion in low-diversity settings, though with limitations for typologically distant, low-resource languages.

Together, these findings highlight the limitations of predominantly English-centric post-training, showing that increasing language diversity can systematically improve both English performance and cross-lingual generalization.

## 2 Related Work

#### Multilingual Post-Training

Prior work on multilingual post-training primarily falls into two paradigms: data substitution, which replaces part of English data with multilingual data, and data augmentation, which adds multilingual data on top of an English baseline.

Substitution-based studies find that small replacements can improve multilingual performance, but larger substitutions often yield diminishing returns, degrade English performance, and offer limited benefits for low-resource languages, highlighting trade-offs under a fixed data budget (Shaham et al., [2024](#bib.bib16); Kew et al., [2024](#bib.bib8)).

Our work adopts the data augmentation paradigm, reflecting practical post-training settings where English data remains fixed and additional multilingual data is added to improve generalization (Shimabucoro et al., [2025](#bib.bib18)). Prior augmentation work typically samples data uniformly from a fixed set of languages and reports mixed findings: some observe gains only for parameter-efficient methods like LoRA (Chen et al., [2024](#bib.bib2)), while others also find improvements under full fine-tuning (Shimabucoro et al., [2025](#bib.bib18); Lai & Nissim, [2024](#bib.bib11)). However, uniform sampling makes it difficult to disentangle whether gains stem from increased data volume or from language diversity.

To better isolate these effects, we explicitly control language coverage during training. Similar to Ji & Chen ([2025](#bib.bib6)), we incrementally add languages, but rather than following a fixed expansion order, we systematically vary both the number and composition of languages in each mixture. While Ji & Chen ([2025](#bib.bib6)) report strong gains from including the test language during training, our results further highlight the role of language diversity in driving strong cross-lingual generalization, even in the absence of direct test-language inclusion.

#### Task-Dependent Effects of Multilinguality

Beyond training mixture design, prior work suggests that the impact of multilinguality also depends on the task. Linguistically driven generative tasks, such as summarization or open-ended dialogue, tend to benefit more from multilingual training than highly structured tasks such as classification or reasoning (Shimabucoro et al., [2025](#bib.bib18); Kew et al., [2024](#bib.bib8)). We build on this observation by evaluating multilingual post-training across two complementary task types: mathematical reasoning (symbolic reasoning) and API calling (structured generation). While mathematical reasoning has been examined in prior multilingual studies (Lai & Nissim, [2024](#bib.bib11); Shimabucoro et al., [2025](#bib.bib18)), the multilingual dimension of API calling has received less systematic attention. Huang et al. ([2025](#bib.bib5)) include a multilingual function-calling evaluation task across 17 languages as part of a broader benchmark suite, and Kulkarni et al. ([2025](#bib.bib10)) introduce MASSIVE-Agents, a multilingual function-calling benchmark spanning 52 languages. However, neither work studies how multilingual post-training mixtures affect function-calling.

## 3 Experimental Details

### 3.1 Tasks and Datasets

We evaluate multilingual fine-tuning on two tasks covering different aspects of model capability: Mathematical Reasoning for symbolic reasoning, and API calling for structured generation.

#### Task 1: Mathematical Reasoning

Mathematical reasoning is a widely used task for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (Shi et al., [2022](#bib.bib17); Lai & Nissim, [2024](#bib.bib11)). We examine how multilingual exposure during fine-tuning impacts mathematical reasoning performance across our evaluated languages.

For training, we use mCoT-MATH (Lai & Nissim, [2024](#bib.bib11)), a large-scale multilingual math reasoning dataset that provides chain-of-thought solutions for math word problems in 11 languages. During both training and evaluation, we elicit chain-of-thought reasoning by prompting the model with the language-specific equivalent of the phrase “Let’s think step by step” immediately before answer generation, consistent with the prompting format used in mCoT-MATH. For each language, we sample 10,000 parallel examples for training and 200 examples for validation.
For testing, we use the MGSM benchmark (Shi et al., [2022](#bib.bib17)), a human-translated set of 250 grade-school arithmetic reasoning problems for multilingual evaluation.

Evaluation: Following prior work, we extract the model’s final predicted answer from its generated output and compute accuracy against the ground-truth answer.

#### Task 2: API Calling

Table 1: Languages used in our study, grouped by their role in training and evaluation.

Tool-augmented LLMs offer numerous benefits such as improved real-time access, reduced hallucination, and more efficient workflows (Qu et al., [2025](#bib.bib14)); however, most current datasets remain English-centric, limiting multilingual tool-use.

Therefore, we introduce mAPICall-Bank, a multilingual dataset for training and evaluating API calling across 11 languages. Built on API-Bank (Li et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)), which assesses LLMs’ ability to call external tools in realistic, multi-turn dialogue scenarios across diverse domains and APIs, mAPICall-Bank focuses on the API calling subtask where models generate the correct API invocation given a user utterance and a candidate API pool. We construct the dataset by translating API-Bank into 11 languages using a state-of-the-art LLM (see Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") for the prompt); it contains 3,174 training and 399 test examples per language, with non-overlapping APIs between splits. In our experiments, we hold out 150 examples from the training split for validation. To our knowledge, mAPICall-Bank is one of the first multilingual API calling datasets, and we release scripts to regenerate it with varied LLMs as the translation engine publicly, to support future research. We show dataset statistics in Table [4](#A1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") in Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training").

Evaluation: We parse the model’s output to extract the API name and the dictionary of argument–value pairs. A prediction is marked correct only if the API name, all argument names, and all corresponding argument values exactly match the ground truth.

### 3.2 Multilingual Training Setup

We use a set of eleven typologically diverse languages (Table [1](#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Task 2: API Calling ‣ 3.1 Tasks and Datasets ‣ 3 Experimental Details ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training")), following prior multilingual work (Shi et al., [2022](#bib.bib17); Lai & Nissim, [2024](#bib.bib11)), which form the basis for our training mixtures and evaluation settings. Our evaluation focuses on five ‘core’ languages: English (En), Spanish (Es), Japanese (Ja), Bengali (Bn), and Swahili (Sw), chosen to span a range of resource levels, language families, geographic regions, and writing systems. To further test generalization to unseen languages, we additionally evaluate on Telugu (Te), a low-resource language not included in any training mixture. The remaining languages—French (Fr), Thai (Th), German (De), Russian (Ru), and Chinese (Zh)—are used only to expand multilingual training mixtures beyond the evaluation set.

Using these languages, we construct a series of training mixtures that progressively increase language diversity while keeping comparisons controlled (Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training")). In each mixture, all included languages contribute the same number of parallel examples, which isolates the impact of language coverage from differences in data volume. Starting from the five core languages, we construct mixtures with progressively more languages, introducing additional ones to increase diversity. For intermediate diversity levels (e.g., 2, 4, 6, or 9 languages), we evaluate multiple combinations of the core languages, as indicated by the “x4” or “x5” configurations in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training"). This design ensures that observed effects reflect general trends across language combinations rather than any single language, while still enabling controlled analysis of individual language inclusion.

### 3.3 Model Backbones

We experiment with two open-weight LLM families: Qwen-3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 8B) (Yang et al., [2025](#bib.bib19)) and Gemma-3 (1B, 4B) (Kamath et al., [2025](#bib.bib7)). For each model, we use the officially released pretraining-stage checkpoints to ensure that observed performance reflects task-specific fine-tuning on our dataset rather than prior instruction tuning.

### 3.4 Training Details

We train each model on each data mixture for six epochs using 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs. All models use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5, a cosine learning rate scheduler with a 3% warmup ratio, and a weight decay of 0.01. We maintain an effective batch size of 64 per GPU (global batch size of 512), adjusting the micro-batch size and gradient accumulation steps as needed based on model memory requirements. Gradient checkpointing is enabled to reduce memory usage. For each mixture, we select the checkpoint with the highest average validation set task accuracy across all languages in that mixture, ensuring that selection does not implicitly favor any individual language within the mix.

## 4 Results

### 4.1 Multilingual Scaling is Largely Beneficial Across Tasks and Model Scales

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/x2.png)


Figure 2: Effect of increasing training language coverage on model performance for Qwen-3 and Gemma-3 models. Plots show average accuracy (%) with 95% Wilson confidence intervals as a function of the number of training languages, grouped by high-resource and low-resource evaluation languages, for API calling (top) and math reasoning (bottom).

We first analyze the overall impact of scaling multilinguality by increasing training language coverage. Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Multilingual Scaling is Largely Beneficial Across Tasks and Model Scales ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") reports mean accuracy (95% Wilson confidence intervals) for Qwen-3 and Gemma-3 models of varying sizes, evaluated across both tasks and grouped by high- and low-resource languages, as a function of the number of training languages.

Across both model families and tasks, performance generally improves or remains stable as more training languages are added, with low-resource languages benefiting the most and high-resource languages plateauing rather than degrading. This holds consistently across model scales of 1B parameters and above, suggesting that at sufficient capacity, increasing language coverage during post-training is largely beneficial without incurring negative transfer.

An exception to this trend arises for the smallest model (Qwen-3 0.6B) on API calling, where performance initially improves with increasing multilinguality—up to four languages for high-resource and five for low-resource settings—before showing a slight decline as additional languages are introduced, suggesting capacity-driven multilingual interference at this scale. We do not observe similar degradation for mathematical reasoning or in larger models, indicating that this effect is confined to sub-1B models and the more structured API calling task.

Due to experimental noise, we validate these trends using a pooled regression analysis in Section [4.4](#S4.SS4 "4.4 Pooled Regression Analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") across the full set of experiments. This provides additional evidence for the benefits of increasing language coverage during training. Additional per-language trends are provided in the Appendix [C](#A3 "Appendix C Multilingual Scaling Trends Per Language ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training").

In the following subsections, we zoom in on specific regions of this trend to better understand the effects of multilinguality. We first examine the low-diversity (bilingual) setting (Section [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 English Is Not All You Need: Even Minimal Multilinguality Helps ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training")), and then analyze the high-diversity regime (Section [4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 High Linguistic Diversity Supports Generalization Comparable to Direct Exposure ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training")), where increased language coverage enables stronger cross-lingual generalization.

### 4.2 English Is Not All You Need: Even Minimal Multilinguality Helps

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/x3.png)


Figure 3: Median accuracy (%) change from bilingual versus English-only post-training across evaluation settings for API calling and math reasoning. Error bars show 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. Bilingual training yields consistent gains across evaluation settings, with the largest improvements under direct exposure and smaller but reliable gains under cross-lingual transfer.

We next examine the low-diversity (bilingual) setting to understand whether even minimal multilinguality is beneficial. Specifically, we compare English-only post-training to bilingual training that includes English and one additional language. Figure [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 English Is Not All You Need: Even Minimal Multilinguality Helps ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") reports median accuracy differences across English and non-English evaluations (95% bootstrap confidence intervals), while Table [2](#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4.2 English Is Not All You Need: Even Minimal Multilinguality Helps ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") summarizes win rates across configurations. For non-English evaluations, we distinguish between direct exposure—where the evaluation language is included during training—and cross-lingual transfer, where it is not.

Across evaluation settings, bilingual training consistently outperforms English-only post-training. The largest gains occur under direct exposure, yielding median improvements of 9.27% for API calling and 8.4% for mathematical reasoning, with wins in 87.5% of configurations.

These benefits extend beyond the added language. Even when the evaluation language is absent from training, bilingual models improve performance through cross-lingual transfer (+3.38% for API calling and +1.6% for mathematical reasoning), outperforming English-only training in 74.4% of configurations.

Notably, multilinguality also improves English performance, with median gains of 0.88% for API calling and 3.4% for mathematical reasoning, and wins in 75% of configurations.

We provide fine-grained per-language results for English-only and bilingual post-training relative to pretraining in Appendix [B](#A2 "Appendix B Monolingual vs. Bilingual Transfer Heatmaps ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training"), shown as heatmaps over source–target language pairs. As expected, post-training in nearly any language and setting improves performance across all languages.

Together, these results show that English-only post-training is suboptimal: even minimal multilingual exposure yields gains that generalize across languages, tasks, and model scales.

We next turn to higher-diversity settings to examine how increasing language coverage further shapes cross-lingual generalization.

| Evaluation Setting | Win Rate | 95% CI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EN | 75.0% | [59.8, 85.8] |
| Non-EN (Direct Exposure) | 87.5% | [73.9, 94.5] |
| Non-EN (Cross-Lingual Transfer) | 74.4% | [67.1, 80.5] |

Table 2: Win rates of bilingual post-training over English-only post-training across evaluation settings, aggregated across tasks and models. A win is defined as a configuration where bilingual training achieves higher accuracy than English-only training.

### 4.3 High Linguistic Diversity Supports Generalization Comparable to Direct Exposure

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/x4.png)


Figure 4: Comparison of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer versus direct bilingual exposure at varying levels of language diversity for Qwen-3 8B (top) and Gemma-3 4B (bottom), with 4 (left), 6 (middle), and 9 (right) training languages. High-resource languages (red) tend to cluster near the diagonal, indicating strong zero-shot generalization that can compensate for the absence of direct inclusion. Low-resource languages (blue) more often fall below the diagonal, suggesting greater benefit of direct inclusion.

Having established that even limited multilingual diversity is beneficial, we now ask how far these generalization effects extend. Specifically, can sufficient language diversity during post-training compensate entirely for the absence of the target language in training?

Figure [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 High Linguistic Diversity Supports Generalization Comparable to Direct Exposure ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") compares a low-diversity bilingual setting with direct exposure to the evaluation language against higher-diversity settings (4, 6, or 9 languages) where the evaluation language is *excluded* and performance relies entirely on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. In the figure, the diagonal indicates parity between the two settings, with points near or above it indicating that zero-shot transfer matches or exceeds direct exposure. We present results for the largest models in each family (Qwen-3 8B and Gemma-3 4B) in the main text, with additional model sizes provided in Appendix [D](#A4 "Appendix D Additional Results on Linguistic Diversity Driven Cross-Lingual Generalization ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training").

High-resource non-English languages generalize well under increased diversity. Results for high-resource languages (red) tend to lie close to the diagonal, especially at higher diversity levels (6 and 9 languages). In particular, zero-shot performance is statistically indistinguishable from or significantly exceeds that of bilingual direct exposure in 100% of cases for the 9- and 6-language settings, and in 87.5% of cases for the 4-language setting (two-sided t-test), suggesting that linguistic diversity alone is sufficient to drive strong generalization for these languages.

Low-resource, typologically distant languages benefit more from direct inclusion. Results for low-resource languages (blue) more often fall below the diagonal, indicating that zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is less able to compensate for the absence of direct training exposure. Even in the 9-language setting, zero-shot performance is statistically indistinguishable from direct exposure in 62.5% of cases, but never significantly exceeds it — in contrast to high-resource languages, where zero-shot transfer matches or exceeds direct exposure, indicating a stronger reliance on explicit inclusion for these languages.

English also benefits from zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Despite being the dominant language in post-training, English performance also improves with increased language diversity even without direct English supervision. Across tasks, zero-shot cross-lingual performance significantly exceeds or matches bilingual direct exposure in 100% of cases for the 9- and 6-language settings, and in 75% of cases for the 4-language setting. API calling shows stronger gains from increased language diversity, with cross-lingual performance significantly exceeding direct exposure in 50% of cases and never significantly underperforming, suggesting that models can leverage structural and lexical variation from diverse languages even without direct English supervision.
  
Prior work has shown a strong reliance on English for reasoning processes even in multilingual settings, suggesting that mathematical reasoning may require more English supervision for optimal performance (Etxaniz et al., [2024](#bib.bib4); Schut et al., [2025](#bib.bib15)). Our results show that this dependence diminishes with increased language diversity. Even for mathematical reasoning evaluated in English, zero-shot cross-lingual performance matches direct exposure when 6 or more languages are included during training, though results are more variable at lower diversity (4 languages), where 50% of cases perform worse than direct exposure.

Overall, these results show that at sufficient language diversity, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer can match or even exceed direct language inclusion for high-resource and English evaluations, though limitations remain for low-resource, typologically distant languages. This interpretation is further supported by the pooled regression in Section [4.4](#S4.SS4 "4.4 Pooled Regression Analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training"), which shows that broader training-language coverage remains positively associated with performance even after controlling for direct target-language inclusion.

### 4.4 Pooled Regression Analysis

To test whether the patterns in Sections 4.1–4.3 persist in aggregate, we fit a pooled regression model over evaluation instances, where each instance corresponds to evaluating a trained model on a task-language pair. The regression includes model family, task, pretrained-only status, whether the evaluation language appears in the training mixture, log10\log\_{10} model size, and a transformed measure of training-language coverage, defined as L/Lmax\sqrt{L/L\_{\max}} to allow diminishing returns with additional languages. We fit the regression on a random 70% split of evaluation instances and evaluate on the remaining 30%, where it achieves an out-of-sample R2R^{2} of 80.5%. We report on coefficients with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. We interpret this analysis as complementing the analyses above with an aggregate summary over evaluation instances.

The pooled analysis confirms several expected trends, including benefits from larger models, post-training, and direct inclusion of the evaluation language. Importantly, broader training-language coverage is positively associated with performance even after controlling for direct target-language inclusion (β=0.053\beta=0.053, 95% CI [0.018,0.089][0.018,0.089]). This is consistent with the discussion above indicating that multilingual gains are not explained solely by direct language exposure.

| Feature | Coef. | 2.5% | 97.5% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| log10\log\_{10} model size | 0.302 | 0.285 | 0.319 |
| Qwen model family | 0.265 | 0.248 | 0.281 |
| Math task | -0.207 | -0.221 | -0.193 |
| Pretrained only | -0.110 | -0.167 | -0.047 |
| Eval. language in training | 0.089 | 0.074 | 0.104 |
| L/Lmax\sqrt{L/L\_{\max}} | 0.053 | 0.018 | 0.089 |

Table 3: Pooled regression over evaluation instances, where each instance corresponds to evaluating a trained model on a task-language pair. The model is trained on a random 70% split of instances and evaluated on the remaining 30%, achieving an out-of-sample R2R^{2} of 80.5%.

## 5 Conclusion

This work presents a study of multilingual post-training under realistic conditions, examining how language coverage and composition interact with model capacity and task structure. Our analysis spans both reasoning and tool-use settings.

Our findings show that English-centric post-training is typically suboptimal for cross-lingual transfer. Increasing language coverage helps performance for all languages, including English, and can compensate in some cases for a lack of direct inclusion of the target language in training, although these gains are limited for typologically distant, low-resource languages. We find that with limited exceptions for API calling at the smallest scales (≤1​B\leq 1B), models are able to benefit from increased multilingual diversity, particularly for low-resource languages, without degrading performance in high-resource languages.

## 6 Limitations

Our work provides a systematic study of multilingual post-training under controlled conditions, but several limitations remain. First, our analysis focuses on 11 languages, which do not capture the full global linguistic diversity of thousands of languages worldwide. To partially address this, we select languages spanning a broad range of resource levels, language families, geographic regions, and scripts. Second, although our experiments span multiple model scales and two model families, the largest model we consider contains 8B parameters, and it remains an open question how multilingual scaling effects evolve at larger model sizes. To isolate the effects of language coverage, we hold the amount of data per language constant and therefore do not examine how jointly scaling data volume and language diversity interacts with model capacity or task difficulty. Additionally, our multilingual datasets are constructed via translation of English task data, which may introduce translation-specific artifacts (e.g. “translationese”); future work could investigate whether similar effects hold for naturally occurring multilingual data. Finally, our analysis focuses on mathematical reasoning and API calling as post-training tasks; other task domains may exhibit different behavior under multilingual scaling.

## Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/figures/mapicallbank-example.png)


Figure 5: Example showing the final turns of a parallel multi-turn API calling interaction from mAPICall-Bank in three languages: (a) English, (b) Spanish, and (c) Bengali.

We construct mAPICall-Bank by translating the API calling subset of the original English API-Bank dataset into multiple target languages using a state-of-the-art large language model. The full translation prompt is provided in Figure [6](#A1.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training").

During translation, we preserve the full structure of each example, including user utterances, system responses, API names, and argument schemas. To maintain compatibility with tool specifications, API names and parameter keys are kept in English across all languages, while user-facing text and, when appropriate, argument values are translated into the target language.

The translation prompt was iteratively refined to ensure structural validity and parseability of model outputs. In particular, we enforce that translated examples retain the original formatting and can be reliably parsed into API name and argument–value pairs. We perform automated checks to validate output structure (e.g., JSON format) and manually inspect a subset of examples across languages, with native speakers verifying linguistic accuracy and consistency with the source data.

Figure [6](#A1.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") shows the prompt used to translate API-Bank to create mAPICall-Bank. Figure [5](#A1.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") shows an example of a parallel multi-turn interaction involving a single API call across three languages. Dataset statistics including the number of queries, unique APIs, and examples of APIs in the train and test split of mAPICall-Bank are shown in Table [4](#A1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Appendix A mAPICall-Bank Construction ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training").

## Appendix B Monolingual vs. Bilingual Transfer Heatmaps

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/figures/monolingual_vs_bilingual_qwen.png)


(a) Qwen-3 Models

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/figures/monolingual_vs_bilingual_gemma.png)


(b) Gemma-3 Models

Figure 7: Change in accuracy relative to the pre-trained baseline for bilingual versus English-only post-training. Heatmaps show performance differences across evaluation languages when English is paired with a single additional language (top: API calling; bottom: math reasoning). Subfigures (a) and (b) correspond to Qwen-3 and Gemma-3.

Figure [7](#A2.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ Appendix B Monolingual vs. Bilingual Transfer Heatmaps ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") presents heatmaps of accuracy change relative to the pretrained baseline for monolingual and bilingual training settings. Each cell shows the difference in performance when training on a given source language (or language pair) and evaluating on a target language.

These results complement the findings in Section [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 English Is Not All You Need: Even Minimal Multilinguality Helps ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training"). Consistent with the observation that English-only post-training is suboptimal, we find that adding a second language generally leads to positive gains across a wide range of evaluation languages. Notably, improvements are not limited to the added language: many bilingual configurations yield gains even when the evaluation language is not included in training.

Further, the heatmaps show that gains are broadly distributed across language pairs rather than concentrated in a small subset, suggesting that the benefits of multilingual post-training are not driven by specific language combinations but reflect a more general effect of multilingual exposure.

## Appendix C Multilingual Scaling Trends Per Language

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/figures/multilingual_scaling_qwen.png)


(a) Qwen-3 Models

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/figures/multilingual_scaling_gemma.png)


(b) Gemma-3 Models

Figure 8: Per-language multilingual scaling trends for (a) Qwen-3 models, and (b) Gemma-3 models. Each cell shows mean accuracy as a function of the number of training languages for API calling (top rows) and math reasoning (bottom rows), with scatter points indicating individual results.

Figure [8](#A3.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ Appendix C Multilingual Scaling Trends Per Language ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") presents scaling trends for individual evaluation languages as a function of the number of training languages, for (a) Qwen-3 and (b) Gemma-3 models.

These results complement the aggregated trends shown in Figure [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Multilingual Scaling is Largely Beneficial Across Tasks and Model Scales ‣ 4 Results ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training"). Consistent with the main findings, we observe that with the exception of the smallest 0.6B model, increasing the number of training languages generally improves or maintains performance across most languages and model sizes. Gains are particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, while high-resource languages tend to plateau as additional languages are introduced.

## Appendix D Additional Results on Linguistic Diversity Driven Cross-Lingual Generalization

![Refer to caption](/html/2604.13286/assets/x5.png)


Figure 9: Comparison of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and direct bilingual exposure for smaller models. Rows correspond to Qwen-3 1.7B (top), Qwen-3 0.6B (middle), and Gemma-3 1B (bottom), with columns showing 4 (left), 6 (middle), and 9 (right) training languages.

Figure [9](#A4.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ Appendix D Additional Results on Linguistic Diversity Driven Cross-Lingual Generalization ‣ English is Not All You Need: Systematically Exploring the Role of Multilinguality in LLM Post-Training") presents the corresponding plots from Section 4.3 for smaller-scale models (Qwen-3 1.7B, Qwen-3 0.6B, and Gemma-3 1B).

We observe consistent trends with those reported for larger models: high-resource languages (in red) tend to lie close to the diagonal, indicating that language diversity enables strong zero-shot cross-lingual transfer that matches or approaches the performance of direct inclusion at these scales. Low-resource languages often benefit from explicit language inclusion, particularly at the smallest scale (Qwen-3 0.6B). This is consistent with our findings in Section 4.1, where we observe capacity-driven interference at higher levels of multilinguality for this model.
